I am a PhD student in Computer Science at Viriginia Tech. If you are looking for my home page please visit <a href="http://people.cs.vt.edu/sudo777">my website.</a>. This is my blog space where I blog about my research and ponderings. I have started writing on a topic which I am absolutely fascinated with these days -- video prediction. This page is still in infancy and I will keep updating as and when I find interesting things to share.

I am interested in exploring the domain of video prediction in artificial intelligence context. Simply put video prediction is the task of predicting the next set of frame(s) of a given video. If a video contains an action being performed by a robot, the task is of predicting the next immediate action after the current action. The next immediate action might also be just completing the current action[1] or might be a next logical action after the current action. Wide availability of videos on the web provides a lucrative opportunity for artificial intelligence researchers to leverage them for building models that can be trained for useful AI tasks like the ones mentioned above. Predicting future frames can help autonomous agents perform their tasks better. For e.g. if a self-driving car that takes in a continous feed of images from its surroundings can predict events like accidents before they actually happen based on the inferred motion of the objects in its surroundings they might take action to prevent such events and avoid a mishap from happening. Since consecutive frames of videos are highly correlated videos naturally provide self supervision alleviating the need for human supervision and labeled data and a rich opportunity to develop methods for unsupervised learning.
