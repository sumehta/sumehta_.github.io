{"name":"Sneha Mehta","tagline":"","body":"### Welcome to my homepage!\r\n\r\n<p> I am a <b>1st</b> year Graduate student in <a href=\"http://www.cs.vt.edu\">Computer Science</a> at Virginia Tech.</p>\r\n<p>My current work is at the intersection of computer vision, crowdsourcing and machine learning. In my research assistantship with <a href = \"https://www.kurtluther.com/\">Prof. Kurt Luther</a> I am combining techniques in content-based image retrieval and crowdsourced human intelligence to make sense of visual data. One interesting outcome of this research is to be able to analyze and describe arbitrarily complex images (given little or no context) and be able to predict information about the image.\r\n\r\n### Academics\r\nI hold a Bachelor's in Computer Science and Engineering and a Master's in Mathematics from <a href=\"www.bits-pilani.ac.in/\">BITS, Pilani</a>, India. My brief resume can be downloaded <a href=\"files/resume_Oct2015.pdf\">here</a>.
