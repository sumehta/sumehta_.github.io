My current work is at the intersection of computer vision, crowdsourcing and machine learning. In my research assistantship with <a href = \"https://www.kurtluther.com/\">Prof. Kurt Luther</a> I am combining techniques in content-based image retrieval and crowdsourced human intelligence to make sense of visual data. One interesting outcome of this research is to be able to analyze and describe arbitrarily complex images (given little or no context) and be able to predict information about the image.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n### Academics\r\nI hold a Bachelor's in Computer Science and Engineering and a Master's in Mathematics from <a href=\"www.bits-pilani.ac.in/\">BITS, Pilani</a>, India. My brief resume can be downloaded <a href=\"files/resume_Oct2015\">here</a>. For detailed information please follow this <a href=\"academics.html\">link.</a>\r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n### Work Experience \r\nI have worked as a Research & Development engineer at [Dreamworks Animation SKG](http://www.dreamworks.com/home/) where I worked on a task graph based execution framework for creating and executing complex workflows. The framework lets the user create complex task graphs with each node representing a unit of work and edges representing data dependencies between nodes. It also lets the user deploy the graph to the farm(computing cluster) for execution. I worked with technologies like Python, PyQt, and Pytest-qt.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n### Important Skills\r\nComputer Vision, Machine learning, Python, Django, C++, Linux.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n\r\n### Projects\r\nI am taking computer vision and machine learning courses this semester. To follow some cool assignments and projects I did for my classes go <a href=\"projects.html\">here.</a>\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n### Interests\r\nI like playing sports and have played basketball at national level while in school. These days I am perfecting my badminton skills. Besides sports I like hiking. View photos of some amazing treks I have been on <a href=\"interests.html\">here.</a>\r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n### Contact\r\n<p>\r\n<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sneha.mehta9791\">facebook</a> &nbsp;\r\n<a href=\"www.linkedin.com/in/mehtasneha\">linkedin</a>\r\n</p>",
